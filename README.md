# j-- <br /> 
j-- is a compiler written in Java, for a subset of Java, also called j--. <br /> 
Original source code can be found here: https://github.com/swamiiyer/j-- <br />
My implementation adds the following extensions to j--:
* Interfaces
* Additional control statements
  * do while & for loop
  * switch, break and continue
* Exception handling
* double and long data types
