1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   This project has two parts. The first part included creating a IsPrime.class file through the use
   of CLEmitter. This class accepted one integer argument from the command line and printed whether the integer
   is a prime number or not. In the second part, we added arithmetic operations, bitwise operations and shift operations
   to the j-- language. In order to do this, the compiler had to scan the tokens, generate an AST and compares it to the
   j-- grammar then generate the machine code for these operations.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name                 Status       Help Received

   Professor Swami      Professor    Confirmed that booleans can be represented by integers.


3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

    I had a lot of fun doing this and felt like this was a perfect assignment to get introduced to j--. I was thinking
    of ways to allow j-- to allow this syntax:

    void main() {
        // code here
    }

    Instead of the incredibly painful:
    public static void main(String[] args)
