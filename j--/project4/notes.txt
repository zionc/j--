1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

    For Project 4, we included scanning and parsing for multiline comments, long and double basic types,
    operators, conditional expressions, switch, do-while, for, break and continue statements, exception handlers and
    interface type declaration. We did this all in the j--.jj file which is the input file to JavaCC that creates the parser
    and scanner. Using BNF syntax we defined tokens for JavaCC and the parser as well. For the parser, it included two sets of
    curly braces. The first set handled local variable initialization, the second included the grammar implementation for parsing which is embedded in a
    try block with error handling. Lastly, java statements, which are syntactic actions, are included between curly braces.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.
