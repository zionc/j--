1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   We added more features to j--. The first being, allowing the scanner to ignore multi line comments. Next, j--'s scanner
   can now tokenize more operators and reserved words. Finally, j-- can also create tokens for double and long literals.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------

   ...                ...          ...

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   The double literals forced me to write a DFA, and once I had the DFA it was easy to implement. Overall very
   fun!
