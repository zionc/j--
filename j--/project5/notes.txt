1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   For this project we completed semantic analysis and codegen for double/long literals, operations, assignment operations, do-while,
   for, switch, break/continue, exception handling and interfaces. The first step was to analyze, to do this, we made sure to resolve the type first
   by calling analyze on that statement or expression, then performing type checking - ensuring the expected types are present.
   Then, assuming all the times are correct, performed codegen, some by simply calling codegen, but others, using correct instructions
   that match the expected outcome and input (ensuring what is on the stack is correct for the instruction). Some of these instructions
   (for, switch, break, continue exception handling) also included creating labels and placing them in specific spots to correctly implement
   control flow.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   This was a fun project from start to finish! I learned a lot and have considered potentially creating a C
   compiler, in C, for a subset of the C language and call it C--. If I do end up pursuing this, I'll let you know
   and make sure to provide this class as inspiration in my documents.
   Thank you!
