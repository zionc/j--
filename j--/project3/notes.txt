1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   For this project we added parsing support for operators. We also added parsing support
   for ternary if/else, do, for, break, continue, switch, try throw and throws statements.
   Lastly we added parsing support for interface declaration. Parsing only checks if scanned tokens
   are syntactically correct, we did not create code gen code for it.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   This was pretty difficult compared to previous projects but this was very fun.
   Doing these also puts a lot of focus on the internal workings of java.
